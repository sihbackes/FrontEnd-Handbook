      <!-- ? Event Bubbling  -->
      <!-- * Event bubbling is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM when an event is in an element inside another element, 
           * and both elements have registered a handle to that event. It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the 
           * event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. In event bubbling, the event is first captured and 
           * handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements. -->
      <!-- ? How to Stop Event Bubbling  -->
      <!-- * Event Bubbling is a default behavior for events. But in some cases, you might want to prevent this, is this case you can use stopPropagation() method. -->
