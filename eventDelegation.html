   <!-- ?  Event Delegation   -->
   <!-- * Event Delegation is a pattern based upon the concept of Event Bubbling. 
   * It is an event-handling pattern that allows you to handle events at a higher level in the 
   * DOM tree other than the level where the event was first received. 
   * With event delegation, instead of handling the click event on the button, you can handle it on the div.
   * The idea is that you "delegate" the handling of an event to a different element (in this case, the div, which is a parent element) 
   * instead of the actual element (the button) that received the event. -->
